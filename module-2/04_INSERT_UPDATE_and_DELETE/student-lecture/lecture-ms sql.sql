-- LEFT JOIN 

 -- Let's display a list of all countries and their capitals, if they have some.

-- Only 232 rows
-- But we’re missing entries:

-- There are 239 countries. So how do we show them all even if they don’t have a capital?
-- That’s because if the rows don’t exist in both tables, we won’t show any information for it. If we want to show data FROM the left side table everytime, we can use a different join:




-- Find out if there are any countries which do not have any cities in the city table

-- Is there another way to do this?



-- INSERT

-- 1. Add Klingon as a spoken language in the USA
-- 2. Add Klingon as a spoken language in Great Britain


-- UPDATE

-- 1. Update the capital of the USA to Houston
-- 2. Update the capital of the USA to Washington DC and the head of state


-- DELETE

-- 1. Delete English as a spoken language in the USA
-- 2. Delete all occurrences of the Klingon language 


-- REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY

-- 1. Try just adding Elvish to the country language table.

-- 2. Try inserting English as a spoken language in the country ZZZ. What happens?

-- 3. Try deleting the country USA. What happens?


-- CONSTRAINTS

-- 1. Try inserting English as a spoken language in the USA

-- 2. Try again. What happens?

-- 3. Let's relocate the USA to the continent - 'Outer Space'


-- How to view all of the constraints

SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CONSTRAINT_COLUMN_USAGE
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS


-- TRANSACTIONS

-- 1. Try deleting all of the rows from the country language table and roll it back.

-- 2. Try updating all of the cities to be in the USA and roll it back

-- 3. Demonstrate two different SQL connections trying to access the same table where one happens to be inside of a transaction but hasn't committed yet.
